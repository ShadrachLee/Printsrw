<h1>Control the Time / WAIT</h1>

<section>
Let's do "wait" to a IchigoJam.<br>
A blinking square cursor on the screen means that the keyboard is ready for use.
<div id="wait1-1"></div><script>make15("wait1-1", "WAIT60")</script>
Did you see that this cursor has disappeared for a short time? Let's try again.
</section>

<section>
If you change the number behind "WAIT", the length of "wait" will be able to change.<br>
â€»1 second = 60
<div id="wait1-2"></div><script>make15("wait1-2", "WAIT120")</script>
The cursor has disappeared longer than before.
The time it takes for the cursor to return is longer than before.
</section>

<section>
Light the LED, and turn off automatically.
<div id="wait1-3"></div><script>make15("wait1-3", "LED1:WAIT120:LED0")</script>
Use the colon ':'(easy to mistake semicolon ';') to concatenate commands.<br>
"LED1" to light a LED, "WAIT120" to wait 2 seconds, "LED0" to turn off a LED.
Light with "LED1", wait with "WAIT120", turn off with"LED0".
</section>

<section>
It lights the LED a bit.
<div id="wait1-5"></div><script>make15("wait1-5", "LED1:WAIT3:LED0")</script>
If you change the number for "WAIT", changes the light pattern of the LED.
</section>

<section>
The LED lights two times..
<div id="wait1-6"></div><script>make15("wait1-6", "LED1:WAIT3:LED0:WAIT3:LED1:WAIT3:LED0")</script>
You can connect more and more with the colon ":".
</section>

<section>
<b>Try it!</b><br>
1. Let's do "WAIT" for 10 seconds<br>
2. Light the LED for 5 seconds and turn it off<br>
3. After typing "WAIT 10000", in the middle, press the ESCAPE key<br>
4. Light a bit after lighting for a long time
5. Try to light the LED with a cool pattern<br>
